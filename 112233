Part 1: Python Question
This question consists of three tasks. You should create a single Python source file and write the code for each task in the same file. You should name the file your_name_python_task.py (fill in your own name).

Python Task 1: Python Basics and Data Manipulation [13 Marks]
You have been provided with a CSV file, shop_sales.csv, containing sales data for a shop. The file contains the following columns: Date, Item, Category, and Units_Sold (this is the number of units sold that day). Your task is to write a Python program that performs the following operations:

Task 1a: Data Loading and Preprocessing
Load the Data: Load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. Print the first 5 rows and the DataFrame shape. [2 marks]
The output should be similar to this one when the code is run.

=== Task 1a-1: Data Loaded ===

         Date        Item     Category  Units_Sold

0  13/06/2025      Laptop  ELECTRONICS        95.0

1  12/03/2025      Marker   STATIONERY        18.0

2  27/01/2025       Mouse  ELECTRONICS         5.0

3  08/01/2024  Headphones  ELECTRONICS        30.0

4  10/05/2025  Headphones  Electronics        92.0

Shape: (50, 4)

 

2.      Data Cleaning:

Convert the Date column to a datetime object. Print the column type for Date . [2 marks]
Here is the example output when the code is run.

=== Task 1a-2: Date dtype after conversion ===

datetime64[ns]

 

Check for and handle missing values. If any are found, fill them with appropriate values. Print the number of missing values after filling.  [2 marks]
Here is an example of the expected output.

=== Task 1a-2: Missing Values ===

Total missing values BEFORE fill/drop: 5

Total missing values AFTER fill/drop: 0

 

Ensure all Category values are uppercase. Print the unique values of Category [2 marks]
This is the expected output when the code is run.

Unique Category values (uppercased): ['CLOTHING', 'ELECTRONICS', 'GROCERY', 'STATIONERY']

 

Task 1b: Data Visualisation
Create a bar chart showing total units sold per category and print the total per category. [2 marks]
Here is the print output when the code is run.

=== Task 1b-1: Total Units per Category ===

Category

ELECTRONICS    779

STATIONERY     644

CLOTHING       579

GROCERY        506

Name: Units_Sold, dtype: int32

 

Here is the plot output when the code is run.



 

Unit Sold per Month: Create a line chart showing the total units sold per month in 2025. The x-axis should represent the months, and the y-axis should represent the total sales.  You must print the total Units per month in 2025. [3 mark]
The print output should be similar to this when the code is run:

=== Task 1b-2: Total Units per Month in 2025 ===

YearMonth

2025-01-01    290

2025-02-01    278

2025-03-01    365

2025-04-01    237

2025-05-01    534

2025-06-01    497

Name: Units_Sold, dtype: int32

 

The line chart should match the example chart below when the code is run:



 

Python Task 2: Python Database Management and File Handling [17 marks]
Problem: Managing Sales Data with SQLite. You must store, query, and export the cleaned sales data processed in Part 1 using SQLite and CSV files.

Task 2a: Database Creation and Data Insertion
Create an SQLite database named ShopDB. [1 mark]
Create a table named Sales with appropriate columns to store the data (Date, Item, Category, Units_Sold ). [2 marks]
Insert the cleaned and processed data from Python Task 1 into the Sales table. Ensure no duplicate entries are added. Print the number of rows inserted.  [3 marks]
The output should be similar to the one below when the code is run.

 

=== Task 2a-3: Insert Summary ===

Rows before: 0

Rows after:  50

Rows inserted (non-duplicates): 50

 

Task 2b: Querying the Database and Exporting to a File
Total Units Sold Calculation: Write a query to calculate total units sold in 2025 and display the result. [3 marks]
The output should be similar to the one below when the code is run.

 

=== Task 2b-1: Total Units Sold in 2025 ===

2201

 

Top Items Sold in 2025 Summary: Write a query to list the top 5 items by units sold in 2025 and save the result to a CSV file called top_items.csv. Print the DataFrame before saving. [4 marks]
The output of the print should be similar to this when the code is run:

=== Task 2b-2: Top 5 Items in 2025 (Preview before saving) ===

         Item  Total_Units_Sold

0      Eraser               210

3      Laptop               180

4      Tablet               150

 

Task 2c: Append New Data to File
After saving top_items.csv, write a code to append a new row with the following values to the top_items.csv:

Item = "Calculator"
Total_Units_Sold = 120
Then read and print the updated file to confirm the row was added. [4 marks]

The output should be similar to this when the code is run:

 

=== Task 2c: Append New Row to CSV and Verify ===

Updated 'top_items.csv':

         Item  Total_Units_Sold

0      Eraser               210

1  Headphones               203

2       Bread               193

3      Laptop               180

4      Tablet               150

5  Calculator               120

 

Python Task 3: Data Logging and Visualisation [10 marks]
In this task, you will write a Python script that records user data to a CSV file, performs simple analysis with pandas and NumPy, and visualises the results using matplotlib.

Task 3a: CSV File Setup
1.      Create a new file named people.csv with the columns:  Name, Age [1 mark]

2.      If the file already exists, your script should not overwrite it; instead, it should append new data to the end of the file. Your code should print an appropriate message depending on whether the file was created new or opened for appending.

If the .csv file was newly created, the output should be as follows [0.5 mark]:

=== Task 3a: File Setup ===

File 'people.csv' created with a header.

If the .csv file was opened for appending, the output should be as follows [0.5 mark]:

=== Task 3a: File Setup ===

File 'people.csv' found. Appending new records...

Task 3b: Data Entry 
1.      Prompt the user to enter one or more records of people’s names and ages. [1 mark]

2.      The user can stop entering data by typing q as the name. [1 mark]

3.      Each valid record should be appended as a new row in the CSV file. [1 mark]

Here are the output and interaction for this task when the code is run. When testing your code, ensure you enter the same records (Name and age) as shown below. They are necessary for the remaining tasks. 

=== Task 3b: Data Entry ===

Enter one or more records. Type 'q' as the name to finish.

Enter name (or 'q' to quit): Mireilla

Enter age: 80

Enter name (or 'q' to quit): Linda

Enter age: 20

Enter name (or 'q' to quit): Ali

Enter age: 28

Enter name (or 'q' to quit): Gus

Enter age: 22

Enter name (or 'q' to quit): Omar

Enter age: 45

Enter name (or 'q' to quit): Yang

Enter age: 24

Enter name (or 'q' to quit): Zhang

Enter age: 25

Enter name (or 'q' to quit): Manu

Enter age: 32

Enter name (or 'q' to quit): q

Data saved to people.csv

Task 3c: Data Summary and Statistics 
After saving the new records, use pandas to read the entire CSV file into a DataFrame.
Print:

·        The total number of records [0.5 mark]

·        The average age [0.5 mark]

·        The minimum age [0.5 mark]

·        The maximum age [0.5 mark]

Save the summary to a text file called summary.txt [0.5 mark]

This is the output when the code is run (make sure you open summary.txt to check that it contains the saved information):

=== Task 3c: Summary Statistics ===

Total records: 8

Average age: 34.5

Youngest age: 20

Oldest age: 80

Summary saved to summary.txt

Task 3d: Visualisation
Using matplotlib, create a simple visualisation of the age data to show the distribution of ages. [2.5 marks]

The output should be a histogram of age frequencies, similar to the example shown when the code is first run.

Here is the expected output.

A graph with numbers and a bar

Part 2: Java question
You will develop classes to implement a minimal turn-based game involving a hero who reads books to learn new skills and uses those skills to battle enemies.

The tasks will get harder as you progress, and build on each other, so try to ensure that you complete each stage before moving on. Be sure to read through the entire specification before you begin to get a sense of all the features that might be needed.

In each task, marks will be awarded for clean code and sensible object-oriented design choices as well as functionality.

We have provided a class, ExamHarness, with a main method that you can use to test your code before submitting. Note that this method will show errors until you have completed the tasks below. You should feel free to modify ExamHarness as you need to test your own code. You will not submit ExamHarness for marking.

Download ExamHarness.java here.

Java Task 1: Representing a hero [10 marks total]
We have provided initial versions of an enumerated type Skill and the skeleton of the Hero class that you should use for this task, which are both in the game package. You must use these classes: do not change the name of the classes or the package.

Download the starter files here:

Skill.java
Hero.java
For our purposes, a hero has the following properties:

Name: Each hero has a name which must be at least 3 characters long.
Hit points:
When a hero is initially created, a maximum HP value is specified, which must be a positive integer. The hero’s initial HP should be set to the max.
When a hero’s HP is updated during gameplay, it should always stay within the range 0..max.
Skill: The current skill that the hero has equipped, represented using the provided Skill enumeration.
When a new hero is created, the skill should be set to Skill.NONE.
Task 1a [4 marks]
Write some code to represent a hero. You should use the provided Hero class as the starting point for this class, but the specific details of the implementation are up to you. Make sure to include a constructor that sets all properties.

Task 1b [2 marks]
Add getter methods for all properties, and setter methods for the name, current HP, and current skill.

Task 1c [4 marks]
Modify your constructor and get/set methods to ensure that the field values are always valid, following the specification above. If someone tries to create or update a hero with invalid values, then an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown, and the change should not take effect.

Java task 2: Library service and books [15 marks total]
Task 2a [5 marks]
Create a class called Book to represent the properties of a book that the hero can read to learn a new skill. The properties should include:

A title (represented as a String);
An author (represented as a String);
A number of pages (represented as an integer); and
A skill to be learned (represented using the Skill enumeration)
Your Book class should have a constructor that sets all fields, and getter methods for all properties. You should also override the equals method so that two books are considered equal if the title and author are the same. You do not need to do any error checking on the book properties and do not need to implement setters.

Also add a method to the Hero class with the following signature and behaviour:

public void readBook (Book book)

This method should update the hero’s current skill to the skill provided by the book and print a message to System.out “<HeroName> has read '<Title>' and now knows: <Skill>”

Task 2b [2 marks]
Define a class Library that stores a collection of Books. The collection should be initially empty.

Add a method to Library with the following signature and behaviour:

public void addBook (Book book)

This method should add the indicated book to the collection. You do not need to check for duplicates, it is fine if multiple copies of a book are in the collection. 

Task 2c [4 marks]
Add a method to your Library class with the following signature and behaviour.

public boolean removeBook (Book book)

This method should look for a book in the collection that matches the input parameter (using equals()). If a matching book is found, remove it from the collection and return true. If no matching book is found, do nothing and return false.

Task 2d [4 marks]
Add one more method to your Library class with the following signature and behaviour.

public boolean assignBestSkillBook(Hero hero, Skill desiredSkill)

If the hero already knows the desired skill, this method should return false and make no further changes
Otherwise, this method should find all books in the library that provide the desired skill – if no such books exist, the method should return false and make no further changes.
Otherwise, it should search through the books that can provide the desired skill and choose the one with the fewest pages. With the chosen book:
Call Hero.read() with the chosen book
Remove it from the library using Library.removeBook()
Return true
Java Task 3: Enemies and battle [15 marks total]
You will implement a simple class to represent an Enemy, as well as a BattleArena class that runs a turn-based alternating fight between a hero and an enemy.

Task 3a [4 marks]
Create a class called Enemy to represent the basic details of an enemy in the video game. An enemy should have name and hit points properties which should behave the same as those for a hero as described above, and you should define getters and setters for both properties with validation as for the hero.

Task 3b [5 marks]
Define an attack method in your Hero class and your Enemy class, with the following signatures and behaviour:

public void Hero.attack (Enemy enemy)

This method should reduce the given enemy’s hit points by a value depending on the hero’s current skill. Make sure that the enemy’s hit points value never goes below zero.

NONE: decrease by 1
SWORDPLAY: decrease by 3
FIREBALL: decrease by 4
 public void Enemy.attack (Hero hero)

This method should reduce the hero’s hit points by 2 every time the enemy attacks. Make sure that the hero’s hit points value never goes below zero.

Task 3c [6 marks]
Implement a class BattleArena with a single static method with the following signature and behaviour:

public static boolean fightToTheEnd (Hero hero, Enemy enemy)

This method should loop until either the hero or the enemy is defeated (i.e., has hit points = 0). The hero should attack first (using the above attack method), then the enemy should attack, and this pattern should continue until one is defeated. You should check for defeat after every time an attack is made by either the hero or the enemy. The return value of this method should be true if the hero wins (i.e., if the enemy is defeated), and false if the enemy wins.
